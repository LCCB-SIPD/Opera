## Introduction

The rapid evolution of e-commerce has transformed the way consumers interact with businesses, leading to increased demand for secure, transparent, and decentralized platforms.  Web3 technologies, encompassing blockchain, smart contracts, and cryptocurrency wallets, offer innovative solutions to address these demands.  The “One For All” e-commerce system aims to leverage these technologies to create a decentralized marketplace that enhances user trust and transactional efficiency.  Notably, this platform integrates the CORE token, the native cryptocurrency of the Core blockchain, aligning with the developer’s role as a Core Ambassador.




## 

The rapid growth of digital commerce has transformed the way businesses and consumers interact. With the increasing demand for online shopping, e-commerce platforms have become essential in providing convenience, accessibility, and efficiency for both buyers and sellers. This project introduces an online e-commerce platform, One For All, designed to cater to various product categories such as food, appliances, and other consumer goods. The platform enables users to engage in seamless buying and selling transactions while ensuring an organized and user-friendly experience. 

Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that separate users into buyers and sellers, One For All provides a single, powerful account type where users can both buy and sell products. This approach allows individuals and businesses to maximize their engagement within the platform, offering flexibility and efficiency. 

To enhance security, the system implements a robust encryption method for handling sensitive data, including session management, pricing information, and cookies. This multi-layered security approach ensures the protection of user information, including usernames, passwords, and domain-related data, reducing the risks of unauthorized access and cyber threats. 



## Statement of the Problem 

Despite the advantages offered by Web3 technologies, their adoption in e-commerce platforms remains limited due to:

•	Complexity in integrating blockchain and smart contract functionalities with existing web technologies.

•	Lack of user-friendly interfaces that cater to non-technical users. 

•	Challenges in ensuring compatibility between decentralized payment systems and traditional e-commerce workflows.

•	Limited adoption of specific cryptocurrencies, such as the CORE token, in mainstream e-commerce transactions. 




## Statement of Objectives 

The primary objective of this study is to develop the “One For All” e-commerce system that:

•	Integrates Web3 technologies to facilitate decentralized transactions.

•	Provides a user-friendly interface using React and Next.js frameworks.

•	Ensures secure and efficient backend processing with PHP and SQL.

•	Supports cryptocurrency payments through smart contract integration.

•	Promotes the adoption and utility of the CORE token within e-commerce platforms. 
  

## Scope and Limitations 

### Scope
Development of a decentralized e-commerce platform supporting cryptocurrency transactions.

•	Implementation of smart contracts for automating purchase agreements.

•	Integration of cryptocurrency wallets for secure user authentication and payments.

•	Utilization of the CORE token as the primary medium of exchange within the platform. 


### Limitations
The system will focus on Core-based cryptocurrencies and may not support all digital currencies.

•	Regulatory compliance and legal considerations for cryptocurrency transactions are beyond the scope of this study.

•	The platform’s performance may be influenced by the current limitations of blockchain technology, such as transaction speed and scalability.

•	Adoption of the CORE token may be limited by its current market penetration and user familiarity. 

## Significance of the Study 

This study explores the integration of Web3 technologies and blockchain into e-commerce platforms, aiming to create a more secure, transparent, and decentralized shopping experience. By examining the practical application of the CORE token and other decentralized tools, the research highlights their impact on consumers, developers, businesses, and the broader tech community.

Consumers - Gain access to a secure and transparent shopping platform that leverages the benefits of decentralized technologies.

Core Community - Demonstrates practical applications of the CORE token in real-world scenarios, potentially increasing its adoption and utility.

Researcher - Enhances the researcher’s knowledge and technical proficiency in blockchain integration, decentralized systems, and e-commerce platforms, contributing to both academic growth and professional development.

Future Researchers - Serves as a valuable reference for future studies related to Web3, blockchain applications, and decentralized e-commerce, encouraging further innovation and exploration in these emerging fields.

   
## Synthesis of RRS

The reviewed foreign studies highlight the transformative impact of Web3 technologies in the realm of e-commerce. These technologies promise improved security, transparency, and greater user autonomy by decentralizing control and enabling trustless transactions. However, despite their technical advantages, these studies also reveal obstacles—particularly in how Web3 is communicated to the public. Terminologies like “NFTs” and “dApps” can confuse non-technical users, resulting in misconceptions and slower adoption. This suggests that clearer branding and real-world use cases are essential to make Web3 more approachable and relevant to mainstream consumers.

## Synthesis of RRL

The foreign literature emphasizes the growing relevance and adaptability of Web3 technologies across diverse sectors, particularly in e-commerce and fashion. It illustrates how decentralized platforms, blockchain, and smart contracts contribute to enhanced transparency, user control, and sustainability. These global insights highlight not only the innovation potential of Web3 but also the broader shift towards user empowerment and decentralized ownership in digital economies. However, concerns surrounding public understanding, branding clarity, and regulatory alignment remain critical barriers to widespread adoption.
