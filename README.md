## Introduction

The One For All platform is designed to expand the opportunities for businesses of all sizes—whether small or large—by providing an enhanced online marketplace experience. Inspired by the traditional Buy and Sell concept in the Philippines, this platform incorporates expanded features to improve user convenience, security, and accessibility. It allows users to seamlessly buy and sell products, ensuring a dynamic and efficient e-commerce environment. 




## Background of the Study 

The rapid growth of digital commerce has transformed the way businesses and consumers interact. With the increasing demand for online shopping, e-commerce platforms have become essential in providing convenience, accessibility, and efficiency for both buyers and sellers. This project introduces an online e-commerce platform, One For All, designed to cater to various product categories such as food, appliances, and other consumer goods. The platform enables users to engage in seamless buying and selling transactions while ensuring an organized and user-friendly experience. 

Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that separate users into buyers and sellers, One For All provides a single, powerful account type where users can both buy and sell products. This approach allows individuals and businesses to maximize their engagement within the platform, offering flexibility and efficiency. 

To enhance security, the system implements a robust encryption method for handling sensitive data, including session management, pricing information, and cookies. This multi-layered security approach ensures the protection of user information, including usernames, passwords, and domain-related data, reducing the risks of unauthorized access and cyber threats. 



## Statement of the Problem 

In today’s competitive market, businesses—especially small and medium enterprises—struggle to gain visibility and reach their target customers. Consumers, on the other hand, often face difficulties in finding a reliable and comprehensive platform that offers a diverse selection of products from trusted sellers. 

The One For All platform aims to bridge this gap by providing a centralized marketplace that connects businesses of all sizes with consumers. By allowing all users to have a single account type with the ability to both buy and sell, the platform simplifies the process, eliminating unnecessary restrictions and improving overall user experience. 

Through this system, users can efficiently manage their transactions, promote their products, and respond to consumer demands while ensuring a seamless and secure shopping experience. 

By addressing these challenges, One For All aspires to enhance online shopping accessibility, improve business opportunities, and ensure secure transactions through advanced encryption measures. 



## Objectives of the Study 

This study aims to develop and implement an e-commerce platform that enhances online business transactions. Specifically, it seeks to:

1. Develop a user-friendly e-commerce website that supports various product categories such as food, appliances, and general merchandise.

2. Provide a single, powerful account type that allows users to both buy and sell products efficiently.

3. Implement encryption techniques to secure sensitive data, including user credentials, session management, and pricing information.

4. Offer a seamless platform that enables users to promote their products and improve visibility.
   
5. Ensure a smooth and secure purchasing experience for all users by incorporating robust security measures. 



## Significance of the Study 

The study provides significant benefits to various stakeholders:

* Business Owners and Consumers: By merging both roles into a single account type, users can easily switch between buying and selling, increasing flexibility and engagement.

* Developers and Researchers: The system serves as a foundation for future improvements in e-commerce security and user experience.

* Economic Growth: By supporting businesses, especially small and medium enterprises, the platform contributes to the digital economy's expansion 
  

## Scope and Limitations 

This study focuses on developing an online e-commerce platform with secure transaction processing and user management. The system allows users to create product listings and purchase items securely. The encryption method ensures the safety of login credentials, pricing values, and transaction data. 

However, the study has the following limitations: 

* The platform does not handle physical delivery logistics; it only facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers.
* The study is limited to fundamental e-commerce functionalities, excluding advanced AI-driven recommendations or automated inventory management.
* The security measures implemented focus on encryption techniques but do not cover external cybersecurity threats such as phishing or social engineering attacks.

By addressing these limitations in future research, the system can be further enhanced to offer a more comprehensive e-commerce experience.
