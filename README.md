## Introduction

  The One For All platform is designed to expand the opportunities for businesses of all sizes—whether small or large—by providing an enhanced online marketplace experience. Inspired by the traditional Buy and Sell concept in the Philippines, this platform incorporates expanded features to improve user convenience, security, and accessibility. It allows users to seamlessly buy and sell products, ensuring a dynamic and efficient e-commerce environment. 

## Background of the Study 

  The rapid growth of digital commerce has transformed the way businesses and consumers interact. With the increasing demand for online shopping, e-commerce platforms have become essential in providing convenience, accessibility, and efficiency for both buyers and sellers. This project introduces an online e-commerce platform, One For All, designed to cater to various product categories such as food, appliances, and other consumer goods. The platform enables users to engage in seamless buying and selling transactions while ensuring an organized and user-friendly experience. 

  Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that separate users into buyers and sellers, One For All provides a single, powerful account type where users can both buy and sell products. This approach allows individuals and businesses to maximize their engagement within the platform, offering flexibility and efficiency. 

  To enhance security, the system implements a robust encryption method for handling sensitive data, including session management, pricing information, and cookies. This multi-layered security approach ensures the protection of user information, including usernames, passwords, and domain-related data, reducing the risks of unauthorized access and cyber threats.
